" Have j and k navigate visual lines rather than logical ones
" This is crucial in Obsidian where lines often wrap
nmap j gj
nmap k gk

" Yank to system clipboard
" This makes 'y' copy to your system clipboard, not just Vim's internal register.
set clipboard=unnamed " or unnamedplus

" --- Obsidian Specific Mappings (using obcommand) ---

" The `obcommand` allows you to execute Obsidian's internal commands.
" To find available Obsidian commands:
" 1. Open Obsidian's Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Opt+I).
" 2. Go to the Console tab.
" 3. Type `:obcommand` in the Obsidian editor (in Vim mode) and check the console output.

" Navigate back and forward in history
" Make sure to unbind these in Obsidian's hotkey settings if they conflict.
exmap back obcommand app:go-back
nmap <C-o> :back<CR>
exmap forward obcommand app:go-forward
nmap <C-i> :forward<CR>

" Reveal active file in file explorer
exmap revealFile obcommand file-explorer:reveal-active-file
nmap <leader>gf :revealFile<CR>

" --- Custom Mappings ---

" Define your leader key (e.g., Space)
" Note: mapleader often doesn't work directly, so you might need to unmap <Space>
" and then use <Space> directly in your mappings.
" unmap <Space> " Uncomment if you want to use Space as leader

nmap H ^
nmap L $

" Quickly remove search highlights
nmap <Esc> :nohl<CR>

" Surround selected text (requires the 'surround' command provided by the plugin)
" For example, select text in visual mode and then type `cs"` to surround with quotes.
" Or `yss"` to surround the current line with quotes.
" Not strictly Vim-surround, but a plugin feature.
" vmap S <Plug>(obsidian-vimrc-surround)

" --- Comments ---
" Lines starting with " are comments in vimrc files.
