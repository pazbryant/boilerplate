# Syncthing ignore patterns for Obsidian Vault
# Ignore the .git directory
.git/

# Obsidian-specific ignores (optional, but recommended for cross-device consistency)
# The .obsidian folder contains settings, plugins, workspaces.
# Often, you want different settings/plugin states on different devices (PC vs. Phone).
# If you want separate settings for PC and mobile:
#.obsidian/

# OR, if you want to sync ALL of .obsidian (plugins, themes, core configs):
# !.obsidian/plugins/
# !.obsidian/themes/
# !.obsidian/snippets/
# !.obsidian/daily-notes.json # Example: if you want to sync core plugin configs
# !.obsidian/app.json # Core app settings might be good to sync
# If you choose to sync .obsidian, be aware of frequent conflicts, especially with workspace files.

# Recommended minimal .obsidian ignore for cross-device sanity:
.obsidian/workspace* # Ignore workspace files (e.g., workspace.json, workspace-mobile.json)
.obsidian/current-workspace.json
.obsidian/graph.json # The graph view state
.obsidian/backups/ # Obsidian's internal backups
.obsidian/appearance.json # Theme settings, if you want different themes on different devices
.obsidian/community-plugins.json
.obsidian/plugins/*.json # Plugin specific data. If you want plugin settings to sync, remove this.
.obsidian/plugins/*.js # Source maps for plugins
.obsidian/plugins/*.css # Source maps for plugins

# Common temporary/system files to ignore (good practice)
~*.md # Temporary Obsidian lock files (tilde prefix)
.DS_Store # macOS specific
Thumbs.db # Windows specific
ehthumbs.db # Windows specific
desktop.ini # Windows specific
.fuse_hidden* # Linux specific
.*.swp # Vim/Neovim swap files
*.bak # Generic backup files
*~ # Emacs/various editor backup files
# etc.

# Example: If you have a folder for attachments that you DON'T want to sync to mobile due to size:
# attachments/
# my_huge_images/
