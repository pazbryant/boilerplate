# Boilerplate Configuration Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of commonly used configuration
files, such as `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc`, that streamline development
workflows.

> **Note**  
> The repository includes configuration files frequently utilized across various
> projects.

## Purpose of This Repository

In addition to storing configuration files, this repository is paired with a
script `./bump-boilerplate` designed to automate the process of copying these
files into new projects. The script leverages `fzf` and `fd` as core CLI tools,
allowing for quick and efficient selection of files. By adding the script to
your `PATH`, it can be accessed globally from the terminal, ensuring seamless
integration into your workflow.
